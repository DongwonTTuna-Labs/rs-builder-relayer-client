# DECISIONS.md

## ADR-0001: This Fork Is Not The CLOB Client

Decision:

```text
Use official `polymarket_client_sdk_v2` for CLOB order/sign/cancel/balance behavior.
Use this fork only for deposit-wallet relayer operations that are not covered by an official Rust relayer SDK.
```

Consequences:

- no CLOB order client is added here;
- consumer apps must keep CLOB and relayer adapters separate;
- this crate must not shape trading strategy/domain models.

## ADR-0002: Upstream Safe/Proxy Code Is Reference, Not Deposit-Wallet Implementation

Decision:

```text
Keep upstream Safe/Proxy code compiling as a reference while adding deposit-wallet-specific modules separately.
```

Reason:

- upstream public examples and APIs are Safe/Proxy-oriented;
- deposit-wallet flow uses `WALLET-CREATE`, `WALLET`, fresh `/nonce?type=WALLET`, and DepositWallet EIP-712 Batch signing;
- Safe/Proxy execute assumptions are unsafe to reuse without wire-level proof.

## ADR-0003: Identity Separation Is Required

Decision:

```text
Relayer API key owner, deposit-wallet owner signer, and deposit-wallet contract/funder are separate identities in the public API and config.
```

Consequences:

- no code may assume `RELAYER_API_KEY_ADDRESS == DEPOSIT_WALLET_OWNER_ADDRESS`;
- tests must prove auth identity and owner identity can differ;
- logs must redact addresses where appropriate but preserve enough evidence for debugging.

## ADR-0004: Production Dependency Must Be Pinned

Decision:

```text
Consumer production builds must use a pinned git `rev` or vendored source.
```

Forbidden:

```toml
rs-builder-relayer-client = { git = "...", branch = "main" }
rs-builder-relayer-client = "0.1"
rs-builder-relayer-client = "*"
rs-builder-relayer-client = { git = "ssh://git@github.com/OrderBookTrade/rs-builder-relayer-client.git", rev = "..." }
```

## ADR-0005: crates.io Publishing Is Disabled

Decision:

```text
This internal fork is consumed by path dependency during development and pinned git rev in production. It is not published to crates.io.
```

Reason:

- the crate is high-risk venue-facing infrastructure;
- public crates.io releases can imply unsupported SDK status;
- audit, provenance, and pinned commit review matter more than public distribution.

## ADR-0006: Deposit-Wallet Submit Builders Must Be Fallible

Decision:

```text
New deposit-wallet WALLET submit request builders that accept caller-provided
signatures or call payloads must return Result and run signer, config, derived
wallet, signature-shape, and batch resource-limit validation before producing a
request body. The legacy infallible
`build_wallet_batch_request_with_signature` helper is removed from the public
crate and `deposit_wallet` re-export surface at the `0.2.0` migration boundary
because it cannot be made source-compatible, non-panicking, and validated with
its original return type. Unchecked WALLET serialization remains crate-internal
and is restricted to validated builders and fixture tests. The raw
`DepositWalletBatchRequest` DTO is not re-exported from the crate root, and its
submit-body fields are crate-private so consumers cannot construct a WALLET
submit body without a validated builder.
```

Reason:

- an infallible helper cannot report invalid signatures, unsupported configs,
  or oversized calldata without either panicking or returning an unchecked
  relayer body;
- unchecked WALLET submit bodies are unsafe for consumer HTTP/live paths because
  they can mix signer, nonce owner, submit `from`, deposit wallet, and config
  identities;
- compatibility callers should migrate to `try_build_wallet_batch_request_with_signature`
  or the validated signed-batch flow before wiring any live submit path.
- the compatibility exception is intentional:
  - who: this PR changed the deposit-wallet public API boundary;
  - what: the old safe infallible WALLET submit helper is removed from public
    exports and replaced by the fallible `try_` API;
  - when: 2026-05-22, recorded as the crate's `0.2.0` migration boundary;
  - why: the old return type could only fail by panicking, silently producing a
    poisoned request, or returning an unchecked relayer body;
  - how: consumers must migrate call sites to
    `try_build_wallet_batch_request_with_signature` and handle `RelayerError`
    before any live submit wiring.

Rollback:

- keep unchecked serializers crate-internal and restrict them to validated
  builders plus fixture serialization tests;
- if a consumer still calls `build_wallet_batch_request_with_signature`, migrate
  it to `try_build_wallet_batch_request_with_signature` and handle
  `RelayerError` at the relayer adapter boundary;
- if a consumer needs raw non-live serialization, add a deliberately named
  test-only or internal API with documented owner, risk, and removal condition
  in the consumer integration PR.
